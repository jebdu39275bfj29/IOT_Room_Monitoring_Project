# IoT Room Monitoring Project
Modern universities and workplaces often struggle with inefficient room usage because users lack real-time occupancy information.
This project introduces a simple but scalable IoT-style solution that monitors rooms, updates their occupancy status, and provides a clean web dashboard for users.

The system simulates sensors (or can connect to real sensors in the future), updates a backend API, and displays room availability through a browser interface.

### Start the Backend
cd backend  
npm install  
npm run dev   # server on http://localhost:3001

### Open the Frontend
open frontend/index.html （or Live Server）
